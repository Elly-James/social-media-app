# TMZ Platform

In this project, the fundamental basics of starting to learn React.js are illustrated. The key main concepts that are used in creating a react app, are illustrated. The app is a simple app illustrating how a user social media platfrom can be made and what componets it should have
The following concepts are covered:

  * Introduction to React
  * Components
  * State
  * Events
  * Controlled form inputs
  * Effect

Increating the app, I used the **cra** method- ``npx create-react-app ejk-mall``
 
## Components Used
1. **App** - Which is the parent compomponent of the app and renders props and data to its children components 
2. **Header** - Responsible for displaying the header of the app, and holds the button for changing the mode to either dark or light mode
3. **Profile** - This is used to populate the profile of the user by displaying their usrname and image
4. **Posts** - This displays the posts by the user, where it reads images from apublic API of foxes and displays them\
5. **Comments** This component is responsible for displaying the comments of users viewing other users profiles when interacting with the platform
